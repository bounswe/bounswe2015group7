Sculture, The Software Project of Future

This is a web platform where you can share your stories and present certain cultures with people.

The Sculture project had its head-start in the astonishing course CMPE 352 of Boğaziçi University. In addition, it is being eagerly developed by about a dozen of computer engineering students, who are known by the name Group 7.

You can read through and get impressed by our wiki, or if you are feeling cool enough, you can take a look at the source code.

This is a sample project which contains the UI structure of the Home screen in the android project.

This is an updated version of the Android Studio's navigation drawer template, errors fixed and add sliding tabs to the toolbar.

This project is temporary and it will be removed after the Home screen in sculture-android updated.

Technical Details:
* Checking out the `res/layout/app_bar_main` will give the idea of placing TabLayout inside of the Toolbar.
* The styling can be used in `res/values/styles.xml`
* CoordinatorLayout with the Translucent status bar is causing the scrolling behaviour have bugs in sculture-android. To fix that check out `res/values/styles.xml`.
